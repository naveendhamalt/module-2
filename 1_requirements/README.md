Introduction
In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring heat. This circuit is developed using “Atmega328”, a linear voltage sensor.Heat is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faranheit” and used the SimuleIDE Software.

Features:
Low Cost.
Checks if the temperature is maintained or not.
Robust System.
Detail requirements
High Level Requirements:
ID	Description	Status (Implemented/Future)
HLR1	When the two switches are closed, the first LED glows indicating the actuation of the system.	Implemented
HLR2	Analog input from the temperature sensor.	Implemented
HLR3	Display.	Implemented
HLR4	User shall be set the temperature.	Future
Low Level Requirements:
ID	Description	Status (Implemented/Future)
LLR1	ADC with Pulse Width Modulation.	Implemented
LLR2	Compatible on different Operating Systems.	Implemented
LLR3	Ac/Exhaust will automatically turns on when temperature increases.	Future
