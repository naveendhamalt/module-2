In this project we are going to design a circuit for measuring heat of the room or surrounding. This circuit is developed using “Atmega328”, a linear voltage sensor.Heat is usually measured in “Centigrade” or “Faranheit” and to measure it I have used the SimuleIDE Software.Mostly it is used in vehicles,Smart Homes etc where it is used to make sure that the equipments used are working efficiently in cold weather.It takes an analog input and generates a temperature accordingly via master slave communication.It is a low Cost and maintainance equipment. It checks if the temperature is maintained or not and can modify the temperature according.
